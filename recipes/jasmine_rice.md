Put oil, salt, spices, and any aromatics like fresh garlic, onions, or veggies in the pan and sautee.

While that is cooking, rinse rice in cold water. Add rice to oil and spices once aromatics have been activated, making sure to evenly coat the uncooked rice with the oil and spices.

Add the water to the pot and cover, leaving on med heat. When it boils, reduce heat and stir. Leave covered and simmering.

After a few minutes, the water will have absorbed into the rice. (highly depends on your stove and heat level. DO NOT leave unattended!) Remove from heat, stir, and serve.
