# Instant Pot Black Beans
## Time: 2h+

### Prep
* put dry black beans in the instant pot (50g/person suggested)
* 250% water per black beans by weight (125g/person)
* Add salt, spices, a bit of sugar, and/or oil to taste
* Add hot peppers, onion, small-diced carrot if desired

### Cook
* Cook for 90min on high pressure

Oil helps the beans to be more smooth and absorb flavor. Very little is needed, less than 1 Tbsp/person.

Consider adding savory spices like Tumeric, Garam Masala, Coriander, Anise, etc. This helps smooth out the overall flavor.

Salt is essential to the dish. For a typical 4-person prep, you'll want a palmful of salt.
