# Quickbread - makes two loaves
## Time: ~2h

### Mix together in large mixing bowl
* 415g flour
* 20g salt
* 40g sugar
* 18g yeast
* 50g oil (canola, etc)

Mix ingredients together thoroughly, stand mixer is great for this.

### Add to bowl while mixing
* 520g water (very warm, don't scorch the yeast)

Allow to become soupy. If you want to add spices like paprika, thyme, basil, tumeric, oregano...now is the time.

### Add remaining flour till dough is good
* up to 485g more flour (900g total, probably less needed)

Add flour a bit at a time while mixing with dough hook. Continue scraping the sides while adding. When the dough becomes a ball and is no longer sticky, allow to mix for another 30s.

Place dough into lightly oiled bowl in a warm place and cover with a towel. (on top of oven preheated to 250F works well) Allow to rise for 60min. At the end of 60min, dough should double in size.

If desired, you can use the mixing bowl, lightly oil the bowl and turn the dough so that it does not stick after rising.

### Shape loaves and prove
Cut dough into two halves. Roll out to flat sheet the width of your bread pan and 2-3 times as long. Small bread pans are best, and this recipe will make two. 

"Roll up" your dough rectangle, pinching occasionally to seal. Avoid creating air pockets, as this will hurt the crumb of the final loaf.

Once rolled, place each loaf in lightly oiled bread pan and put both pans under a towel in a warm place to prove for 30min. Loaves should increase 70-100% in size.

### Bake
Bake uncovered in preheated oven at 425F for 25-30 minutes. Loaves should be hollow when baked well. Turn out onto a cooling rack and let cool at least 15min before cutting.
